# README 

A list of mostly useful apps that I use on macOS that make things easier to get done. I try to stick to one-time purchases or free. 

## General Quickness 

- Clipboard Manager: [maccy](https://maccy.app)
- Typing automator: [Rocket Typist](https://www.witt-software.com/rockettypist/)
  - One-time fee, but a big time saver. I can have it replace text with small shortcuts, as well as templates to make things go faster. This is useful for typing out Linux commands that are very long, repetitive, or for always typing someone's name correctly in Slack. 
  - Example:  `!H` types `hostname -f` 
- Screenshot tool: [shottr](https://shottr.cc) (one time fee, but worth it!)
- Spolight on steroid: [Raycast](https://www.raycast.com/)
- Easy Emoji Picker: [Rocket](https://matthewpalmer.net/rocket/)
- Updates: [MacUpdater](https://macupdater.net/)
- Getting to ChatGPT faster: [MacGPT](https://goodsnooze.gumroad.com/l/menugpt?referrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.macgpt.com%2F&wanted=true)
- Window Management: [magnet](https://magnet.crowdcafe.com)

## Notes 

I have a mix of a few. 

- Daily Notes: [Logseq](https://logseq.com/)
- Project Notes: [Zettlr](https://www.zettlr.com)
- Apple Notes ðŸ“”

## Terminal Emulators 

- [iTerm2](https://iterm2.com)
- [Warp](https://www.warp.dev)

## Cli Based Applications 

- [PopClip](https://www.popclip.app)
  - Start looking at their extensions, this app is so simple, but a magnificent time-saver.
- [Latest](https://max.codes/latest/)
  - Updates for applications in macOS. 
- [TextSniper](https://textsniper.app)
  - A one-time fee, but well worth it. While macOCR is free, this app does better at keeping the text on different lines and can speed up OCR on-screen capture.
- [macOCR](https://github.com/schappim/macOCR)
  - Allows you to type `ocr` and have the text output to your terminal. Apple has a similar feature for images, but it's nice to not need to take a screenshot to quickly grab some text on screen that is not copyable. It does have some problems with special characters at times. 
- [PagerDuty CLI](https://github.com/martindstone/pagerduty-cli)
  - Easy way to interact with PagerDuty. You can use it to find out who is oncall, or also to ack incidents and get incident stats. Documentation is good enough to get things done, but more examples would be nice. 
  - See HomeBrew installation `brew install zph/zph/pagerduty-cli` 
- [pyenv](https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv) 
  - A simple way to manage multiple versions of Python. So easy I don't even know how I got it to work and how it's still working. 
- [homebrew](https://brew.sh)
- [mas](https://github.com/mas-cli/mas)
  - Command line macOS app store. Still experimenting with it, not sure how useful it is. 
  - `mas list` 
  - `mas outdated` 
  - `mas upgrade` 
- [mailsy](https://github.com/BalliAsghar/Mailsy)
  - Generate command line disposable e-mails `mailsy g` and `mailsy m` 
  - `mailsy -help` 

## Kubernetes 

- [kubens](https://github.com/ahmetb/kubectx)
- [stern](https://kubernetes.io/blog/2016/10/tail-kubernetes-with-stern/)
- [popeye](https://popeyecli.io)
