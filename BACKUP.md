# Backup 

This is a mostly personal list of things I would want to backup in the event of moving laptops, or things I'd want to reinstall. 

## Backups 

- Dotfiles (chezmoi)
- Terminal Configurations 
  - Regex highlights 
  - Color scheme 
- `/bin` directory
- Markdown Notes 
- Bookmarks 
- Rocket Typist shortcuts 

## Software (a not comprehensive list)
